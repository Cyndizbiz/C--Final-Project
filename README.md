# C--Final-Project
Home Inventory System. Lost my entire team. In the last two weeks of class, so I coded the entire program myself in one week. 
There was no access to a database (cloud or otherwise) for the demonstration, so I imporvised by writing the information to 
text files. Of course I realize this is not the best way to do this, but the code itself is pretty good, give or take a few 
little bugs that need to be corrected.
